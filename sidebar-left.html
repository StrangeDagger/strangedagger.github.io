						<h2 class="page-title">My Journey in Data Science and GIS</h2>
					</header>
	
					<p>I originally transferred to UC Berkeley as a Cognitive Science major. Upon taking Foundations of Data Science (Data8), the case study on John Snow and his mapping approach to solve the Cholera outbreak stood out to me. The following semester, I became a Social Good consultant for the <strong><a href="https://dssberkeley.com/"> Data Science Society </a></strong> where I put my early technical skills working for the World Wildlife Fund, a non-profit focused on conservation and sustainability. At the time, I had zero GIS experience but nonetheless, I took the chance to lead the mapping visualization portion of the project. I used an online tool called Mapbox and integrated its APIs with LLMs to visualize WWF’s global impact. I decided to take an Intro to GIS class the following semester and saw the learning curve of using ArcGIS Pro as a fun challenge. It’s one of those ‘once you get it, YOU GET IT’ moments that made me even more eager to pursue the world of GIS.</p>


					<p>I’ve have had the privilege of working as a data science consultant on a variety of impactful projects. One of my most rewarding experiences has been my work with organizations like WWF and The Nature Conservancy, where I applied my GIS and data science skills to solve complex environmental issues. Through these roles, I have contributed to habitat conservation efforts, performed land cover analyses, and helped develop strategies to mitigate environmental risks. My work has always focused on producing actionable insights that drive social good and sustainability initiatives.</p>
    
                    <p>At UC Berkeley, I also serve as an internal project manager for the Data Science Society, after consulting for two semesters. I lead projects aimed at making positive contributions to both the local community and beyond. I help new recruits become proficient in the data science lifecycle, from importing and cleaning data to performing exploratory data analysis, applying predictive models, and visualizing results. My experience here has given me a well-rounded understanding of how data science can make a tangible difference in the world.</p>

	
					<h3>Experience</h3>
					<p>In addition to my academic work, I’ve been involved in numerous data science consulting projects that have strengthened my expertise in GIS and data-driven decision-making:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>As a project manager with the <strong>Data Science Society at Berkeley</strong>, I lead initiatives focused on social good and environmental challenges, helping students and teams deliver meaningful outcomes.</li>
						<li>During my time with <strong>UHS</strong>, I worked as a data science consultant, contributing to predictive modeling efforts that improved financial and operational efficiency within the healthcare industry.</li>
						<li>My work with <strong>The Nature Conservancy</strong> focused on leading the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of stream gauge data to support machine learning models for predicting stream flow. My work involved analyzing environmental datasets and creating visualizations to enhance understanding and improve prediction accuracy for conservation efforts.</li>
						<li>In my role with <strong>WWF</strong>, I helped design an interactive GIS map that visualized WWF's global conservation accomplishments, which allowed for better public engagement and understanding of the organization's impact.</li>
